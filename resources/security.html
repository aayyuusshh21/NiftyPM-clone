        <p>
          End-to-end security is our top priority at Nifty, which is why we take
          every precaution to defend your data while maintaining a
          high-performance environment.
        </p>
        <h4>COMPLIANCE</h4>
        <p>
          Nifty is compliant with the
          <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and
          leverages the privacy features built into

        <h4>NETWORK + DATA SECURITY</h4>
        <p>
          We're provided with reports, certifications, and third party
          assessments of Amazon's data center that ensures round-the-clock
          airtight security, which means the same team who can get a package to
          your door overnight is the team who are watching your servers every
          minute.
        </p>
        <h4>APPLICATION SECURITY</h4>
        <p>Nifty's platform is secured and protected in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Communications are encrypted over SSL which is unable to be viewed
            by a third party. This is financial-institute level security.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nifty maintains ongoing Level 1 PCI compliance which is top-level
            credit card storage and processing standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nifty actively monitors ongoing security, performance and
            availability 24/7/365. We run automated security testing on an
            ongoing basis, as well as contract third parties for penetration
            testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have daily backups stored on separate servers to maintain data
            security and viability.
          </li>
          <li>We offer Single-Sign-On security as an on-boarding option.</li>
        </ul>
